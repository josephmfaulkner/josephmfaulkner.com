              <p>
              I have over five years of professional experience developing and maintaining software systems that store, retrieve and process business information. 
              <br></br>
              As a Fullstack Software Developer, I have been responsible for supporting service-desk which has given me extensive experience interacting with users to diagnose and resolve software errors. I have also coordinated with Business Analysts and software users to develop and implement solutions that meet the needs of the company.
              I donâ€™t have a particular goal with this website. I just wanted a place to show off my stuff. 
              Hope you enjoy exploring my work.  
              </p>
